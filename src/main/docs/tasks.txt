SCRIPT REDO
    - need to do weapons next (the primary/etc is messing up entity calls)
     
    - remove actions
    - can probably remove primary/secondary/etc from weapons (specific scripts)

  - find weapon by "find held" and add there in captain_chest
  - get rid of findweapon ???

  - eventually models and such on entity?
  - should we get rid of everything in entity and just do it per project entity (probably?)









- if no pose, just set ONCE
- allow any [] to be null in json


- rework multiplayer
   - logon needs to have project name, pass back game & map name
   - clients need to be in a paused state until final synch message
   - don't enter other players until synch is OK
   - call sync at very end (move stuff in stageNetworkConnectOK)

INTERFACE
  - menu by keys
  - gamepad support

DEMOS
  - kart: weird bug with laps near goal line
  - kart: going backwards
  - fps: pulses need to be in json
  - fps: bots run away if no ammo?
  - fps: death messages by game with json setup

MISC
  - run some more profiling
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs from old version

NETWORKING
  - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
  - predictions
  - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)
