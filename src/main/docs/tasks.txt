SCRIPT REDO


- animations need to be done differently, we need weaponfirelasttick kind of thing for bots/players



- EntityCacheClass delete when all json gone

- this.core.game.timestamp
- remove core.entities, core.effects
- animations and sounds as new AnimationDef() and new SoundDef()
- sequences need scripts
- remove actions


- bots: need to recheck everything
   - make sure pauses at elevators are working


[NEW KART MAP - get rid of ground and put flag ground segments, fix seams]

- if no pose, just set ONCE


- rework multiplayer
   - logon needs to have project name, pass back game & map name
   - clients need to be in a paused state until final synch message
   - don't enter other players until synch is OK
   - call sync at very end (move stuff in stageNetworkConnectOK)

INTERFACE
  - menu by keys
  - gamepad support

DEMOS
  - kart: crashes have weight effect
  - kart: going backwards

MISC
  - run some more profiling

NETWORKING
  - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
  - predictions
