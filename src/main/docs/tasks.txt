- make effect constants instead of names
- make programmable interface for billboards/etc in effects
   x.add(blah)
      .add(frame)
      .add(frame);

- jsonName in effects

2. clean up weapon fields
3. do demo pickups



- EntityCacheClass gone!

SCRIPT REDO

 - canBeClimbed into physics
 - clean up weapon fields

- fps adds weapons statically like kart



    - need to do weapons next (the primary/etc is messing up entity calls)
     
    - remove actions
    - can probably remove primary/secondary/etc from weapons (specific scripts)

  - get rid of findweapon ???

  - eventually models and such on entity?

  ----> runWeaponFiring  move most of that to weapon (bots will have to clip change, too)
         - hitscan/projectile to entity?

-- redo weapon -> player animation completely

  FINALLY: map_entity_list.addFromMap/addDynamic




- if no pose, just set ONCE


- rework multiplayer
   - logon needs to have project name, pass back game & map name
   - clients need to be in a paused state until final synch message
   - don't enter other players until synch is OK
   - call sync at very end (move stuff in stageNetworkConnectOK)

INTERFACE
  - menu by keys
  - gamepad support

DEMOS
  - kart: weird bug with laps near goal line
  - kart: going backwards
  - fps: pulses need to be in json
  - fps: bots run away if no ammo?
  - fps: death messages by game with json setup

MISC
  - run some more profiling
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs from old version

NETWORKING
  - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
  - predictions
  - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)
