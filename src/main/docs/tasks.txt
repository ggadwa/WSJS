SCRIPT REDO

> do model/physics for all weapons/projectiles
> clean up weapon fields
> remove entity_weapon/projectile when all clear
> transition entity_fps_player/entity_fps_bot to statically add weapons
   - get rid of initiallyAvailable when done
   - redo all the third person weapon animations, get code from bot.js

- EntityCacheClass gone!

- animations and sounds as new AnimationDef() and new SoundDef()
- sequences need scripts
- remove actions

  FINALLY: map_entity_list.addFromMap/addDynamic


- ambients (on effects)
   - crackling fire
   - fountain

[NEW KART MAP - get rid of ground and put flag ground segments, fix seams]

- if no pose, just set ONCE


- rework multiplayer
   - logon needs to have project name, pass back game & map name
   - clients need to be in a paused state until final synch message
   - don't enter other players until synch is OK
   - call sync at very end (move stuff in stageNetworkConnectOK)

INTERFACE
  - menu by keys
  - gamepad support

DEMOS
  - kart: weird bug with laps near goal line
  - kart: going backwards
  - fps: pulses need to be in json
  - fps: bots run away if no ammo?
  - fps: death messages by game with json setup

MISC
  - run some more profiling
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs from old version

NETWORKING
  - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
  - predictions
  - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)
