- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)

- swipe up for grenade
- explosions seem to hurt too much

BLENDER
 - break up circuit road
 - get rid of loadGLTFJson hack (no scene, use name of folder)
 - make metallic/roughness only way, error if missing
 - generate_bitmap_base / addGenerated needs to change -- search all for "specular" and "glow"

SHADOW MAPS
 - turn off cube eliminator (or fix first)
 - do we need the uv changes?
 - try mipmaps again
 - sort lights by intensity
 - still have seams
 - uploads need to delete old map/folder


EDIT MODE
  - right click to start split
  - no movements
  - stop all sounds

- bouncing up on bits of pillar in castle map is bad, should not be able to stand on those

- multiplayer needs a complete rebuild

- bots
   - they seem to continue to fight with the dead
   - extra weapon fires (needs config for how often it uses extra weapons)

- kart move out the weapons, clean up entity_kart_player from weapons, implement follow floor projectile

- death messages by game with json setup

- bots/remotes (no need for game json for remotes)

- eventually clean up entity and unecessary pass through APIs
- need to test failures (missing bitmap, missing json, bad json, etc)

- need to go over all the auto generate options


- make a 2D demo

- need to do some optimizations

- networking
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

- generator
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme

    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)

    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line

    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
