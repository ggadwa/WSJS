When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


- outdoor lights need special operations

- get rid of rooms.length===1 to always make outdoors

- y randomize is bad (not skipping floor segments)
+ need tree + rock decorations for outdoors

+ only static lights from windows
+ whats with the resetAnimation errors (on monster wake)
+ monster meele, fire and meele sounds

----> Get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW

    setMovementForward(on)
    setMovementBackward(on)
    setMovementSideLeft(on)
    setMovementSideRight(on)
    setSpeed(speed)
    setLifeTick(lifeTick)
    setFireSoundBuffer(fireSoundBuffer)
    setHitSoundBuffer(hitSoundBuffer)
    setDamage(damage,splashRadius,splashDamage)
    setNoGravity(noGravity)
    setLob(lob)
    setBounce(bounce,bounceFactor)
    setReflect(reflect)
    setName(name)
    setProjectile(projectile)
    setAltProjectile(altProjectile)


+ constants need to be with objects

+ fix the binding bug on projectiles
+ close() -> release()
+ playerEntity makes weapons


***** TRACK ALL initialize/release, and don't use close()


+ projectiles have ammo & time to fire on them
+ weapons have two projectiles only, ammo on projectiles
--> bounce projectiles can bounce forever
--> projectile speed needs to be > entity speed
--> stuff in genMap that can go to constants
--> 3rd person view
