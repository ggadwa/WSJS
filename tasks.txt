
- path generator needs to detect unreachable paths
- need idlePath: ["abc","def","hij"] (vampires)
- need stalkByPath: true (dragon queen)

- platform - spikes have edges closer, first spike further down
- platform - rocks taller
- platform - bounce off monster (on the monster json)
- platform - monster chase

- kart = drift is weird for bots
- kart = place is wonky
- kart = explosions push
- kart = pickups seem to start on each other


DEVELOPER
  - work on developer path split
  - way to put in node key name
  - stop all movements / liquids

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping (if you bump but can't move fully, than completely stop motion -- check stairs)

BOTS
   - run away if no ammo?

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs
 - get rid of animation index in modelentityalter (only ever have one track)

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - make the whole thing part of developer
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
