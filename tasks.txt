


- map pieces to typed arrays



- reduce number of varrying to get more lights

- light maps
    - need smear and smooth
    - need a no collision mesh (like lights) so they can be highlighted
    - precalc meshes within light range, only search those meshes for collisions
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need simple lighting flag
    - need diffuse calcs
    - need to avoid by reversed normals



- generator
    - ? randomize vertices
    - do random inside version (so it's a O)





-- will need start and stop
    - close meshes
    - close gl
