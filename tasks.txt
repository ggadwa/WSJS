ES6
    [ ] modularize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass (search all constants)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


ToDos

#### cubicles are still touching each other in places
#### for computers, make computer 50% of time, 25% for control panel or junction box
#### window needs own texture (frame texture)
#### platforms always extend to parent room

#### liquid in overlay
#### end room big enough for boss?  boss monster?  need boss flag? (config.MONSTER_BOSS)

#### eventually remove getDecorationCount() -- this can't work for all of them

#### office decorations?
#### frame doors?

#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### flyers models
#### draw closest map meshes first
