- map settings



- monsters
   - need state / asleep / waking up / hurting / melee / firing / idle / stalking
   - need to wait for animation to complete on each state, can't interrupt
   - pause based on animation fps count
   - remove the old hard set flinch/etc/pauses
   - rename melee left/right
   - can't fire or melee if not in stalk state
   - only turn if stalking
   - make a wake-up and death trigger and spawn trigger (close gate?)
   - warp in spiders on wake up 
   - separate animations and sounds on entities into own object

- get kart bots working again

- eventually get rid of import_map/import_model?






- swipe up for grenade
- fix seams on sky box?

SHADOW MAPS
 - uploads need to delete old map/folder

EDIT MODE
  - right click to start split
  - way to put in node key name
  - stop all sounds

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping
  - bouncing up on bits of pillar in castle map is bad, should not be able to stand on those

BOTS
   - they seem to continue to fight with the dead
   - extra weapon fires (needs config for how often it uses extra weapons)

KART
  - kart move out the weapons, clean up entity_kart_player from weapons, implement follow floor projectile

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unecessary pass through APIs

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes

DEMO
    - made a 2D demo
