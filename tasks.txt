
IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor


VERTEX PILLARS
 - skip if point is missing any other polygon (need to keep wall mesh around)
 - make a single segment type and use it across all cylinder in a room


---> possible use of drawarrays since all the trigs are static in map meshes?
---> make sure to get rid of debug.drawModelSkeleton in view
---> frustum cull the models

- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - entityList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
