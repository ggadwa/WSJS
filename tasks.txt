When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


this.movement.z in entity is bad

--> DO AWAY with AI, make entity_monster_stalk, entity_monster_boss, entity_monster_fire
    + get rid of ai and gen_ai classes
+ stairs can be next to doors (keep away from edges)
+ decorations can be in stairs
+ stacked boxes are awful
+ only static lights from windows
+ whats with the resetAnimation errors

----> Get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW

+ constants need to be with objects

+ map style types: indoor/outdoor/space
+ do rocks in a different way, place randomly, but collide and move them out of the way of other rocks

OUTDOOR
  - sparse = hallways only
  - medium = hallways and extensions
  - compact = extensions
  - tunnels instead of hallways
  - grass texture (use fur texture) / tunnel texture (dirt & rocks) / walls need to be restricted to stone or wood textures
  - better dirt texture

+ fix the binding bug on projectiles
+ close() -> release()
+ playerEntity makes weapons
+ do AI types [stalk (melee), fire (get within firing distance), sniper (stay at firing distance), boss (stalk, melee, and fire)]

***** TRACK ALL initialize/release, and don't use close()


+ main can get some imports removed (gen stuff)
+ projectiles have ammo & time to fire on them
+ weapons have two projectiles only, ammo on projectiles



--> bounce projectiles can bounce forever
--> projectile speed needs to be > entity speed
--> monster meeles

--> stuff in genMap that can go to constants
--> storage needs smaller & bigger box random

--> need junction (box with wires or circuits)

--> commonize generate in bitmaps
--> 3rd person view

--> sounds need to be same way

--> models cast light


#### need meeles for monsters
#### stairs need quads or blocks at top
#### ai types (charge, sniper, etc)
#### windows have different bar types/glass
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### draw closest map meshes first
