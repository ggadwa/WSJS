EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] bitmapList.release();
    [ ] soundList.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes


#### what's wrong with shots not hitting monsters?
#### monster ai: speed,project=null no projectile
#### deal with health and damage

#### animals better
#### blobs better
#### weapon models


#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### still need to figure out door/staircase problem

#### projectiles
      - need floor hits (implement)
      - gravity, initvalue, add (test)
      - bounce, bounce factor (implement)
      - reflect (implement)









       


[X] game now has a paused mode (starts in that mode)
[X] implemented pointer lock and free mouse controls when possible
[X] walls with doors no longer break into other rooms except for door
[X] collisions are now calculated off the randomized models
[X] monsters can have projectiles
[X] lots of lightmapping updates, highlighted meshes, skipped meshes, bug fixes, speed ups, etc
[X] ability for meshes to skip light map obscuring (for things like full lit light pieces)
[ ] started work on monster AI variations
[ ] started work on weapon variations
[ ] started work on projectile variations
[X] some more debugging options


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
