IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] code to scan and covert settings to input controls
    [ ] create and save projects in indexedDB

REGULAR TODOs


[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] rooms have possible light positions
[ ] rooms track where they put platforms on 10x10, and monsters appear outside that, and one monster per square

[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture

[ ] physics
    [ ] jumping
    [ ] gravity

[ ] light maps
    [ ] need to check closest meshes first
    [ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
    [ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call, highlight in lightmap

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] models
    [ ] frustum cull models
    [ ] need to put legs up so shrinking works better
    [X] models need vertex object with position, normal, uv, bone index, bone offset
        [X] build uv, tangent, etc the first time, build vertex and normal on the fly
    [X] bones need pose position and original position
    [ ] need to rotate vertexes on posing
        [ ] and normals
    [ ] debug need to use pose positions
    [ ] eventually get rid of bone "is" functions (leave base)
