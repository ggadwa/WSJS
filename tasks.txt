- reduce number of varrying to get more lights

- light maps
    - need to be done by timer
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need smear and smooth
    - precalc all the triangle vertexes, store in parallel mesh object




- generator
    - ? randomize vertices
    - do random inside version (so it's a O)





-- will need start and stop
    - close meshes
    - close gl
