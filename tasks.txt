FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] code to scan and covert settings to input controls

REGULAR TODOs



[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] rooms have possible light positions


[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] bitmaps
    [X] normals are off for bolts (or frame is too large)
    [X] need metal + bar
    [X] need to have one set per map
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [X] metal textures more light gray
    [X] fix lines on rock textures
    [X] corregated metal texture
    [X] plaster wall texture
    [X] metal needs a thin version
    [X] fix bolt problems (normals, bottom cut off)
    [ ] machine texture


[ ] jumping
[ ] gravity

[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call
    [ ] need to highlight these in lightmap!


[ ] frustum cull models

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] collisions
     [ ] gravity


[ ] model generation
  	[ ] need globe generators
 	[ ] combine close vertexes
 	[ ] do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    		torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random
