[ ] added open ceilings
[ ] more decoration types
[X] separated and cleaned up the code for all the different bitmap generation types, separated in debug mode
       
[ ] add ability for projectiles to have different gravity settings, bounce, and reflect



[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
