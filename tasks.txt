WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped and either 100% rigged or no skinning at all]

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data

if indexes never change in effects, don't rebuild (fire and smoke) - also use periodic calls


2. liquids need to draw away from z
6. be able to start animation paused (at certain second of animation)

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
