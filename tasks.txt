IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] can we do static getCONTANT_NAME() { return(1); } etc for constants?  PROBABLY NO, wait for 7?
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] general
    [X] fixed some bug in lost float/int conversions
    [X] speed up bitmap creation

[ ] map generation
    [X] flag to make all generated lights white (the default)
    [ ] TRY: start with single solid platform and stairs, exapand vertical or horizontal randonly from that to wall
    	[ ] platforms with no solid area (make that less likely) can have any number of 4 poles on edges
    	[ ] some platforms can be reduce to one edge (full, left, right, top, bottom) watch for steps
    [ ] TRY: remember closet locations, and from any closet side, expand in 3 direction and fill in if hit another closet

[ ] textures
    [X] added 3 monster textures, scales, fur, and a doom-ish leathery type
    [X] "plaster" texture has more color components
    [X] better stones in rough stone texture
    [X] more variations in wood textures
    [X] metal textures now have a blue-ish tint instead of white tints
    [X] corrigated metal has deeper texture and better normals
    [X] some over-all specular collections

[ ] models
    [X] speed up model creation
    [ ] will need to seam the 0->1 edge

    
    
    [X] fixed a bug that would create split areas in models
    [ ] hands and feet separate globes
        [ ] bad normals in feet because of bone connections
    
    [X] make limbs bilateral
    [X] get legs as booleans (does bone X have legs) and always two

    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [ ] smooth globes or have locked shrink coordinates (like no Y change on body, etc)

[ ] entities
    [X] fixed a bug where entities could spawn in the same place if platforms turned off

[ ] weapons
    [X] add weapon system
    [X] make dynamic weapon model construction
    [X] clear z-buffer?

[ ] projectiles

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture
