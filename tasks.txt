

- !!!NOTE!!! eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)


- obscuring by view port of meshes
- start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)



- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release()
    - text.release()
