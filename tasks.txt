IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] convert setting to scrolling input controls
    [ ] create and save projects in indexedDB

REGULAR TODOs

[ ] stair wells are special room collision cases, has to be < or > not >= or <= because can't hide sides

[ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call
    [ ] need to highlight these in lightmap!

[ ] pillars need separate object and pillar locations and ONLY single story rooms

[ ] better second floor stuff
    [X] can we combine neg and pos versions of steps?
    [ ] stairs need to build normals always (pass into creation function since they will be equal)
    [X] looks like stair polys have a bug
    [X] random pick for next but skip previous (add one) -- use for second floor instead of just +1
    [ ] need to make one size the stair side and then the other sides by a random % (25, 50% etc)
    [ ] exits can be on any level?

[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] metal needs random plating (1 big, 2 long, 4 quarters)
    [ ] normals are off for bolts (or frame is too large)
    [ ] need metal + bar
    [ ] need to have one set per map

[ ] rooms have possible light positions

[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] need filterMapBitmapColors and filterModelBitmapColors


[ ] frustum cull models
[ ] when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] collisions
     [ ] gravity


[ ] model generation
  	[ ] need globe generators
 	[ ] combine close vertexes
 	[ ] do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    		torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random
