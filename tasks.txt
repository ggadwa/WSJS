#### seam in skybox
#### hexagons need to be more interesting

#### genBitmapModel in main.js delete later

#### sound constants in soundgen
#### remove soundlist also

#### move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play) -- BACK TO REGULAR PANNER (ugh)



#### machine -> equipment, have 2 to 4 parts (vertical) each part can be pipe or machine


--------------> do path based maps, always go up, than right?  Corridors that separate blobs?
                    * make room
                    * add up or right corridor
                    * now add other rooms around it
                    * map size by number of encounter rooms?


#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first
