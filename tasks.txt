IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor




[X] level ups are stair hallways
[ ] stairs are their own js code and only make necessary polygons
[ ] do NOT need 2nd story to have stairs

[ ] try to pack light struct floats


[ ] need steel panel rooms

[ ] add the 8-way room

[ ] need real polygonal floors

[ ] need to use all black lightmap chunks
[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] need filterMapBitmapColors and filterModelBitmapColors


- keep a list of open 20/20 spots in rooms
    - need flip and mirror
    - use that to build box platforms to stairs


- don't draw spaces in text


maps
 - better second floor platforms


collisions
 - gravity

lighting
 - light map in worker threads?



model generation
 - combine close vertexes
 - do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random

---> needs decoration location?
---> make sure to get rid of debug.drawModelSkeleton in view
---> frustum cull the models

- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - entityList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
