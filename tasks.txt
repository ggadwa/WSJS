WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### projectiles
      - bounce, bounce factor (implement)
      - reflect (implement)

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded

#### light mapping is pretty crappy in places, more than likely because of low resolution

#### better wall sliding

#### outside sections
#### implement swimming

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### news in lines (defs.h)
#### turn towards was broken, get all the angles working right
