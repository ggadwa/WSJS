WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes




0. models aren't being properly culled

1. missing globe on moon walk
   1a. missing skeleton on moon walk

2. get rid of u/v scale in import settings

3. all collision and box routines have to be fixed
4. all frustum stuff has to be fixed
5. why is uv swapped? (only on objs it seems)
6. underwater collision bad

1. need to import non-UV trigs as flat textures
    1a. create textures
2. figure out textures

2. get rid of broken double windows in OBJ
3. translate OBJs to GLTF?

4. meshclass flags -- delete?
5. vertices -> vertexes (use same spelling)
6. indicies -> indexes



1.6 merge collision into entity
2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
    - just position/angle and collisions
3. work on collisions
   0a. make sure to combine any lines/floors that we can
4. get back to updateVertexesToPoseAndPosition
4a. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics


- get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW
  (a lot of this has already been deleted, here for future reference)
