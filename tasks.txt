- start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
- move around some of the code into more folders
- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- need font bitmap/fps/drawing routines
   - precreate the text vertex buffer

    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close meshes
    - close gl
    - text.release()
