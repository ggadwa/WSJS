WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

- recheck mouse wheel on windows

- make it work in safari
- work on touch controls
    - left side, move and turn
    - right side, look and shoot, swipe left/right weapon change, swipe up for grenade

- make fire part of explosion shrink back (fast)

- bots hitscan for player

- need spawn only nodes

- ammo and stuff needs to reappear

- swimming is broken


- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z
- jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
- combine input / view pause states

project_entity to remove
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
