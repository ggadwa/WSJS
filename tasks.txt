IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor


[X] put OLD way of cubes back!  light map UVs will be bad!
[ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call
    [ ] need to highlight these in lightmap!

[X] fix line normals (in rough stone)
[X] mosaic floor

[ ] pillars need separate object and pillar locations and ONLY single story rooms

[ ] better second floor stuff
     [ ] U, L, T, +
     [ ] go upwards 1 floor length

[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] need steel panel rooms

[ ] rooms have possible light positions

[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] need filterMapBitmapColors and filterModelBitmapColors


- keep a list of open 20/20 spots in rooms
    - need flip and mirror


- don't draw spaces in text


collisions
 - gravity


model generation
 - combine close vertexes
 - do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random

---> needs decoration location?
---> make sure to get rid of debug.drawModelSkeleton in view
---> frustum cull the models

- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - entityList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
