
--> setting dialog needs a "quit to title" when in game

--> entities
      - rename folder to entity

--> audio
     - click sound for title (need audio.soundStartUI)
     - need to be able to start/stop looping sounds in dialogs
     * entities keep own sounds?
     - only load sounds from entities that are in level (later, optimization)

--> models
     - whats problem with animations wacky on second play?
     - only load models from entities that are in level (later, optimization)

--> touch needs to be completely reworked
     - input is abstracted
     - touch controls are game only (look for touchMenuTrigger, also)

- is map ready needed anymore

--> eventually test full screen
--> runMultiplayerSyncError redo all this

- won/lost songs (kart/platformer)

- kart = tracker bowling ball needs to only track things within path (ahead of it)
- kart = weird bug with laps near goal line
- kart = need win closing
- kart = going backwards
- platform = warp in/dance warp out sequence
- fps = pulses need to be in json


DEVELOPER
  - work on developer path split

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping (if you bump but can't move fully, than completely stop motion -- check stairs)

BOTS
   - run away if no ammo?

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs
  - get rid of animation index in modelentityalter (only ever have one track)

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - make the whole thing part of developer
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
