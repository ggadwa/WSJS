IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] code to scan and covert settings to input controls
    [ ] create and save projects in indexedDB

REGULAR TODOs

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] rooms
     [ ] decorations use location tracking

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture

[ ] light maps
    [ ] need to check closest meshes first
    [ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
    [ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call, highlight in lightmap

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] models
    [X] rebuild normals after shrink wrap to work off of attached bones
    [X] bones have gravity lock distances
    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [X] temp testing -- need to get legs back into default pose for walking
    [ ] debug need to use pose positions
    [X] eventually get rid of bone "is" functions (leave base)
    [X] tweeing must be between angles -- delete all that other stuff!
    [X] need to create children list so we don't have to search entire bone list, and base index
    [ ] wsPoint needs a no-center rotate (use for both bones and verticies)
    [ ] when doing shrink wrap, create array of BONE objects, and then next make temp bone objects along the skeletal line that have scaled values between the other two bones
