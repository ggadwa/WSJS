WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up]


Dungeon to do
 1. start all gates down
 2. start all doors closed
 3. first crypt has crystal & lamp running into each other
 4. lower area in room a bit so I can add deadly slime

0. can go through most of walls in dual castles (bottom pillars)
   -> circleLineXZIntersection seems to be missing walls, need better Y?
0. when maps final, redo it so we have glossy stuff instead of wacky material bit
1. fix dungeon movements when new map
2. transparencies need to be sorted
3. need to sort waves too or at least form in direction away from camera
4. waves need wave direction (x/z/none) - get from u/v change
5. addBillboardQuadToGLList is crap, maybe keep an offset and always add up
     - add a rotation factor to it, rotate glow bitmap in flame (and smoke?)



bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

1. check billboard effect shaders
3. all collision and box routines have to be fixed
6. underwater collision bad
1. merge collision into entity
2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
    - just position/angle and collisions
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
