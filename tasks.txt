
- all the project/entity_? need object seals

- kart = explosions push
- kart = why are shell interface count always at 3?
- kart = pickups seem to start on each other
- kart = settings into json
- kart = skidding needs to actually reduce speed
- kart = update the kart bots and get them working

- platform = blocking rock is too thin
- platform = slow down layer movement

DEVELOPER
  - work on developer path split
  - way to put in node key name
  - stop all movements / liquids

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping (if you bump but can't move fully, than completely stop motion -- check stairs)

BOTS
   - they seem to continue to fight with the dead
   - run away if no ammo?

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - make the whole thing part of developer
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
