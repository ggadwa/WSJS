WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]


- increase size of dungeon

- bots need to stop turning if blocked by moving mesh
  - if one moving mesh, only get off when at top or bottom nearest to next node

- why is mouse wheel broken? (sometimes!  pause state?)

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data

liquids need to draw away from z

jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)

8. combine input / view pause states
9. constants use statics?

project_entity to remove
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
