EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] bitmapList.release();
    [ ] soundList.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes
#### need ability for meshes to skip light mapping phase
#### avoid closets where doors?


[X] fixed some bugs in the physics timing
[X] slight color variations in lighting
[X] packed lights into vec4 to save space, changed light in scene algorithm and now handling 6 lights
[X] some decoration random min/maxes are now dynamic based on room sizes
[X] table decorations are now tables and shelves
[X] better and more precise model sphere wrapping
[X] whip/tail type limbs
[X] random model mesh vertex variations
[X] improved walk animations, added random idle animations
[X] improved the particles
[X] textures types are now marked so maps are less likely to keep picking the same type in the same map
[X] added cement, block wall, metal shutters, and hexagonal texture types
[X] improvements in other textures, plus new dirty streaking options
[X] much better specular generation
[X] added doors
[X] added lifts
[X] added map movements, looping and approach triggered

[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [X] need to create sounds
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
