    [ ] modulize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass

#### need a combine mesh that moves similiar vertices together in secondary mesh

#### for connected rooms, if lower or upper, try to wedge a room in between the staircase and other room to create open access
#### update the walls decorations
#### path needs to be able to turn corner (and remember if it's top/bottom or left/right for extensions
#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### ledges on top and bottom?
#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models
