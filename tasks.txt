WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

quaternion update
  - project_entity
  - camera
  - core.draw

get rid of .rotate/.rotateX/etc from point
get rid of setRotationFromZAngle from matrix
get rid of core.eyeRotMatrix2 after quaternions

- make dual castles a little bigger to stop head getting caught
- work on held gun position


- animations seem to jump at times, maybe loop is bad

need isEntityInRange('player') then check for E key on 

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data

work on paths

2. liquids need to draw away from z

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics

project_entity to remove
    setMovementForward(on)
    setMovementBackward(on)
    setMovementSideLeft(on)
    setMovementSideRight(on)
    movementBounce(bounceFactor)
    movementJump(jumpValue)
    movementReflect()
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
