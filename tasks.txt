WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

- do triggers
  * movements fire triggers
  * 

- need spawn only nodes
- platform waiting seems broken will need actual code here (move wait - on all three nodes)
- instead of backing up, make bots slide left or right depending on angle

- ammo and stuff needs to reappear

- why is mouse wheel broken? (sometimes!  pause state?)
- mouse wheel on os x mice is wacky
- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z
- jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
- combine input / view pause states

project_entity to remove
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
