
*** DO METALLIC/ROUGHNESS TRANSLATIONS
     - generate_bitmap_base / addGenerated needs to change -- search all for "specular" and "glow"


- shadowmap blocking (NoCollision) and no shadowmap (has emissive, or has a mask) instead of flags

- can we get rid of bitmap simple name after we get rid of all the bitmap collision/etc lists?


GET rid of triangle effect & web effect

- dungeon death pit

- use custom meshes for liquid volumes/hurt volumes/effects/  use lights for lights

- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)

- swipe up for grenade
- delete rest of old demo scripts

SHADOW MAPS
 - need to draw to small triangle and smear (use an alpha channel and march towards middle)
 - try mipmaps again
 - uploads need to delete old map/folder


EDIT MODE
  - right click to start split
  - stop all sounds

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping

- bouncing up on bits of pillar in castle map is bad, should not be able to stand on those

- multiplayer needs a complete rebuild

- bots
   - they seem to continue to fight with the dead
   - extra weapon fires (needs config for how often it uses extra weapons)

- kart move out the weapons, clean up entity_kart_player from weapons, implement follow floor projectile

- death messages by game with json setup

- bots/remotes (no need for game json for remotes)

- eventually clean up entity and unecessary pass through APIs
- need to test failures (missing bitmap, missing json, bad json, etc)

- make a 2D demo

- need to do some optimizations

- networking
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)
