IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] can we do static getCONTANT_NAME() { return(1); } etc for constants?  PROBABLY NO, wait for 7?
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();
