- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)

- sound play might need position instead of expecting object with .position (as effects call it)
- wsserver - option to show http log in server (default to off)

- do bitmaps next
- sound distance/loop part of sound play/json

- swipe up for grenade

- vampire sparkle weapon doesn't hit player

EDIT MODE
  - goes directly to fly mode edit control
  - shoot ray to select spot (show mesh in box, color hit polygon?)
  - show effects, lights, monsters, paths

- bots
   - y targeting seems bad
   - extra weapon fires

- kart move out the weapons, clean up entity_kart_player from weapons, implement follow floor projectile

    - death messages by game with json setup
    
    - bots/remotes (no need for game json for remotes)

    - eventually clean up entity and unecessary pass through APIs
    - need to test failures (missing bitmap, missing json, bad json, etc)
    - get rid of any beretta naming

    - need to go over all the auto generate options

EVENTUALLY
    - add kart to demo
    - make a 2D demo

- need to do some optimizations

- networking
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

- generator
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme

    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)

    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line

    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
