MAP_LIGHT_TWO_STORY_BOOST
ROOM_UPPER_TALL_PERCENTAGE
- closests need to pick random story


#### get rid of yStoryBound from room, make it real room size
#### get rid of supergumba liquid testing stuff
#### createWalls in room needs to make both walls
#### better platforms and such (like half room platforms or ones that just go parallel from lift/stairs)
#### path needs to be able to turn corner (and remember if it's top/bottom or left/right for extensions
#### stairs out of water don't always appear
#### need stairs out of water in rooms that edge against water rooms

#### randomize the movement for lifts

#### better monster scream

#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room

#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### genBitmapSkin/genBitmapItem in main.js delete later

#### certain decorations in certain rooms (like computers and boxes and such in externals)

#### finish "supergumba" sound parts that aren't workable until panner/listener position gets implemented



#### machine -> equipment, have 2 to 4 parts (vertical) each part can be pipe or machine


--------------> generation
  - doors, lifts, and liquid in map overlay
  - make win button at last room



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile
#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first
