WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


-> deflip the Y and treat down as negative?
-> IMPORT needs rotate angle

1. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
    - just position/angle and collisions
1. make a particle effect, then remove old particle effect
   1b. particle shader -> effect shader

2. work on collisions
   0a. make sure to combine any lines/floors that we can

4. get back to updateVertexesToPoseAndPosition
4a. delete all weapon stuff from player

5. high->height
6. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
7. eventually delete all stuff in entities folder

8. view -> WSJS?
10. map into view
11. combine input / view pause states


- get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW
  (a lot of this has already been deleted, here for future reference)
