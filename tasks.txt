WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

- map as part of core
- models need to cull all at once (not on a per mesh level) -- get rid of no cull
- models need xRadius, zRadius, yRadius (use ovals for collisions) and use for culling
- need much better frustum culling for models



work on held gun position
need isEntityInRange('player') then check for E key on 

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data

work on paths

2. liquids need to draw away from z

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics

project_entity to remove
