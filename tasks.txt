WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]



- need bigger player radius or why can we look into walls?  Is radius bump failing?
- no bumps if wall segment doesn't have associated floor segment (draw in different color) [maybe]

- work on entity wall trig collisions
- bots need to determine if on moving platforms
- new way to do tinting

- Pt to Pnt

- why is mouse wheel broken? (sometimes!  pause state?)

need isEntityInRange('player') then check for E key on 

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data

liquids need to draw away from z

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)

5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics

project_entity to remove
    movementBounce(bounceFactor)
    movementJump(jumpValue)
    movementReflect()
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
