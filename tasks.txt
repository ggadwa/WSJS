REGULAR TODOs

[ ] all bitmap routines should probably use wsColor

    [ ] need to highlight these in lightmap!

[ ] pillars need separate object and pillar locations and ONLY single story rooms

[ ] better second floor stuff
     [ ] U, L, T, +
     [X] go upwards 1 floor length
	 [ ] need new ceiling texture, use wood panels for second stories

[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats


[ ] rooms have possible light positions

[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] need filterMapBitmapColors and filterModelBitmapColors


[ ] frustum cull models
[ ] when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] collisions
     [ ] gravity


[ ] model generation
  	[ ] need globe generators
 	[ ] combine close vertexes
 	[ ] do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    		torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random
