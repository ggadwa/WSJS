WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

- chrome 74 has public/private fields, handle those when released

- bots hitscan for player
  - if player in site, after every node hit go directly to next linked node that is closer to player
  * bot chase thing that damaged it
  * bot look at player
  * bot fire

- tinting part of player, need a tint function to call from core (look for getDamageTintAttenuation)

        tintAtt=player.getDamageTintAttenuation();
        if (tintAtt!==0.0) {
            tintOn=true;
            this.tintColor.addFromValues(tintAtt,0.0,0.0);
        }
        
        liquidIdx=player.getUnderLiquidIndex();
        if (liquidIdx!==-1) {
            tintOn=true;
            liquid=this.core.map.liquidList.liquids[liquidIdx];
            this.tintColor.addFromValues(liquid.tint.r,liquid.tint.g,liquid.tint.b);
        }


- need spawn nodes
- bot die/respawn

- websockets
        this.socket=new WebSocket('ws://blech');
        this.socket.addEventListener('open',this.open.bind(this));
        this.socket.addEventListener('close',this.close.bind(this));
        this.socket.addEventListener('message',this.message.bind(this));
        this.socket.addEventListener('error',this.error.bind(this));



- ammo and stuff needs to reappear
- swimming is broken


- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z
- jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
- combine input / view pause states

project_entity to remove
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)

### LONG TERM ###

- work on safari (need to wait for public/private class fields)
- work on touch controls (left side, move and turn) (right side, look and shoot, swipe left/right weapon change, swipe up for grenade)
- networking
- persistent server storage
