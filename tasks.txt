WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up]


0. get a better grass

0. transparency sorting
     - when drawing opaque, build into linked list (meshIdx/trigIdx) by view matrix Z in meshList
     - then draw that as transparent
0. when maps final, redo it so we have glossy stuff instead of wacky material bit
1. fix dungeon movements when new map

3. need to sort waves too or at least form in direction away from camera
6. be able to start animation paused (at certain second of animation)

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
