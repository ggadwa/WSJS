- path generator needs to detect unreachable paths
- need idlePath: ["abc","def","hij"] (vampires)
- need stalkByPath: true (dragon queen)


- kart = need win closing
- kart = place is wonky
- platformer = need health
            "healthInitialCount":4,
            "healthMaxCount":4,

DEVELOPER
  - work on developer path split
  - way to put in node key name
  - stop all movements / liquids

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping (if you bump but can't move fully, than completely stop motion -- check stairs)

BOTS
   - run away if no ammo?

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented

    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
