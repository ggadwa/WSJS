IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let
    [ ] move setupGrid() in map_room.js
    [ ] move this.setupBounds(); in map_mesh.js

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs

----> redo all the entity nonsense when we have classes
       * getAngle() getPosition() should go back to angle/position and be getters
       * (touchEntity.getName()==='projectile') use instanceof
       * put instanceof in map_overlay to not so projectiles


#### tails, random vertex moves
#### normals bad in animation (or culling is bad)

[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations
     [ ] get rid of any copy()

[ ] map generation
    [X] new platforms builder
        [ ] platforms need more decorations
        [ ] try to find a way to connect platforms on different rooms together
    [ ] decorations
        [ ] pedestals?
    [X] need ledge builder
        [ ] dup for ceilings? maybe
    [ ] TRY: remember closet locations, and from any closet side, expand in 3 direction and fill in if hit another closet

[ ] models
    [ ] hands and feet separate globes
        [ ] bad normals in feet because of bone connections
    [ ] need separate starting globe sizes for each part - maybe?

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
