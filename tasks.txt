- better light generation
- move all generate stuff to reaper project
- create random nodes for rooms, use grenades to test

- bitmaps
   -> hexagon (working) -> add noise like oval
   -> pipe, needs random line & random screw line
   -> stone is still bad, need some more variations in stone work

- decorations
   -> exit platforms more interesting?
   -> pillars can have bases - no pillars in small rooms?

- networking
   - needs "master" (first in) for games
   - enter
   - leave
   - remotes and updates

- need to make statics for all generate_bitmap_base statics
- room uvs need to be better
- door frames
- better specs (generated with color?)

- implement bot skill
- player hurt noise
- swimming is broken
- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z
- slowly transition to public/private fields

### SAFARI ###

- wait for public/private class fields to land in safari
- work on touch controls (left side, move and turn) (right side, look and shoot, swipe left/right weapon change, swipe up for grenade)
