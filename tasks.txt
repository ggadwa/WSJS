REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes


#### animals better
#### blobs better
#### weapon models


#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### still need to figure out door/staircase problem

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### flying monsters

#### projectiles
      - bounce, bounce factor (implement)
      - reflect (implement)

#### more decorations
      - can combine decorations in one room
      - benches?
      - cages (2 corners, top and bottom)

#### can I pack lighting better?

#### outside sections
#### water rooms
      #### any door or connection gets extra steps
      #### ^ move this to separate function
