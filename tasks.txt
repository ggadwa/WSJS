- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)

- sound play might need position instead of expecting object with .position (as effects call it)
- wsserver - option to show http log in server (default to off)



NEW BLOCK STUFF
     - change weapon fire stuff to primary/secondary blocks (working on)
     - kart mines is weapon/projectile
     - eventually delete most stuff out of project_entity, do direct calls
     - project_entity -> entity_base
     - effect_json -> effect
     - implement health
     - network scores (somewhere other than player?)
     - need to test failures (missing bitmap, missing json, bad json, etc)
     - get rid of any beretta naming
     - bot names/classes/remote classes
     - index.html hack
     - no damage flag


        switch (this.data.startMap) {
            case "Dual Castles":
                return(this.createMap(MapDualCastlesClass));
            case "Dungeon":
                return(this.createMap(MapDungeonClass));
        }

EVENTUALLY
    - add kart to demo
    - make a 2D demo

- KART map fixes
    - ladder is off a bit
    - railing is off in a bunch of places

- need to do some optimizations

- networking
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

- generator
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme

    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)

    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line

    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes

- demo
    - implement bot skill
    - mouse wheel broken chrome/windows
    - fix swimming

- reaper
    - random node start

- kart
