WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up]


++ get rid of transparency pass, only support masks
++ liquids need to draw away from z
++ get rid of alpha in map_mesh.frag

--> getPoseJointMatrixArray don't need to build identity arrays, it's skipped
--> mesh_list turn back on frustum culling

a. if no joint in mesh import than multiply up with cumulative
b. need a no joint flag for model drawing

1. fix dungeon movements when new map

6. be able to start animation paused (at certain second of animation)

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
