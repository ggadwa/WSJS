IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor
    [ ] new ModelLimbObject needs to pass in constant instead of #

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] code to scan and covert settings to input controls
    [ ] create and save projects in indexedDB

REGULAR TODOs


[ ] optimizations
     [X] shared triangle reduction
     [ ] model wrapping
     [ ] light map generation
     [X] normal culling
     [X] show triangle count
     [X] is timing calculated right?
     [X] get rid of U, it normal culls badly
     [ ] in progress bar for models do bitmaps and models separately

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] rooms
     [ ] decorations use location tracking
     [ ] need machines

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture

[ ] light maps
    [ ] need to check closest meshes first
    [ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
    [ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call, highlight in lightmap

[ ] don't draw spaces in text

[ ] models
    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [ ] wsPoint needs a no-center rotate (use for both bones and verticies)
