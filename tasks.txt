REGULAR TODOs



#### blobs should be able to have random whip limbs
#### stacked block textures can have (randomly) altered Y sizes (one line)
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### rounded particles (need bitmap?)

[X] slight color variations in lighting
[X] packed lights into vec4 to save space, changed light in scene algorithm and now handling 6 lights
[X] some decoration random min/maxes are now dynamic based on room sizes
[X] table decorations is now tables and shelves
[X] better and more precise model sphere wrapping
[ ] whip/tail type limbs
[ ] random model mesh vertex variations
[ ] spikes


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [X] need to create sounds
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
