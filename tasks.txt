ES6
    [ ] modularize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

- computers need to be on outside walls, facing in
- mark off computer sections by meshes with no room collisions (need to count doors, to)

#### office decorations?
#### position windows so they don't face other rooms
#### frame doors?

#### path needs to be able to turn corner (and remember if it's top/bottom or left/right for extensions
#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### flyers models
#### draw closest map meshes first
