#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### flying monsters

[X] monster cylinders now are around body size instead of complete size including limbs
[X] better whips on blobs
[X] add sky textures, sky boxes and open ceilings
[X] added liquid textures, liquid rooms, plus connector stairs and lifts
[ ] more decoration types
[X] separated and cleaned up the code for all the different bitmap generation types, separated in debug mode
       
[ ] add ability for projectiles to have different gravity settings, bounce, and reflect



[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations
