EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] bitmapList.release();
    [ ] soundList.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs



#### stacked block textures can have (randomly) altered Y sizes (one line)
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes

#### separate map texture generation from model texture generation (and update debug)
#### make main skip textures already used

[X] slight color variations in lighting
[X] packed lights into vec4 to save space, changed light in scene algorithm and now handling 6 lights
[X] some decoration random min/maxes are now dynamic based on room sizes
[X] table decorations is now tables and shelves
[X] better and more precise model sphere wrapping
[X] whip/tail type limbs
[X] random model mesh vertex variations
[X] improved walk animations, added random idle animations
[X] improved the particles a bit


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [X] need to create sounds
