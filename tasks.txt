    [ ] all the object release()

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes


#### animals better
#### blobs better
#### weapon models


#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### still need to figure out door/staircase problem

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### flying monsters

#### projectiles
      - bounce, bounce factor (implement)
      - reflect (implement)

#### more decorations
      - can combine decorations in one room
      - benches?
      - cages (2 corners, top and bottom)
#### closets more complex?

#### better wall sliding

#### can I pack lighting better?

#### outside sections
#### liquid rooms
#### implement swimming


[ ] make a lot of objects global (map, view, there's only one, no need to pass around)

[X] monster cylinders now are around body size instead of complete size including limbs
[X] better whips on blobs
[X] added skybox and liquid textures (need work, placeholders now)
[X] add sky boxes and open ceilings
[ ] added liquid rooms, plus connector stairs and lifts
[ ] more decoration types
[X] separated and cleaned up the code for all the different bitmap generation types, separated in debug mode
       
[ ] add ability for projectiles to have different gravity settings, bounce, and reflect



[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
