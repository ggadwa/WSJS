ES6
    [ ] modularize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### need room/room wall collisions to show as light blue
#### add doors

#### window rules
       - have a 4-boolean value to tell where window can be
       - extensions can put windows on opposite side of connection
       - path rooms can put windows on connection sides that don't have extensions
       - if window, no central light

#### no outside type elements in higher extension rooms (computers for one, can't track extra connections)

#### end room big enough for boss?  boss monster?  need boss flag?

#### better internal walls
#### office decorations?
#### position windows so they don't face other rooms
#### frame doors?

#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### flyers models
#### draw closest map meshes first
