IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

FUTURE TODOs
    [ ] code to scan and covert settings to input controls
    [ ] create and save projects in indexedDB

REGULAR TODOs



[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] rooms have possible light positions


[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] bitmaps
    [X] normals are off for bolts (or frame is too large)
    [X] need metal + bar
    [X] need to have one set per map
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [X] metal textures more light gray
    [X] fix lines on rock textures
    [X] corregated metal texture
    [X] plaster wall texture
    [X] metal needs a thin version
    [X] fix bolt problems (normals, bottom cut off)
    [ ] machine texture

[ ] physics
    [ ] jumping
    [ ] gravity

[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] no light mesh hits -- needs "has flag" type call
    [ ] need to highlight these in lightmap


[ ] don't draw spaces in text


[ ] model generation
    [ ] frustum cull models
    [ ] erect type -- standing, crouching, all fours -- generate bone random rotations from that
    [X] need globe generators
    [X] need to generate normals
    [X] need body to neck cylinder
    [ ] don't build shapes by going over bones, do by finding bone names
    [X] pick sizes that always cause overlap
    [ ] better feet
    [ ] facial features additional meshes
    [ ] randomize meshes, always make bigger from center
    [X] rename tangent space utility
    [ ] combine close vertexes (maybe)
