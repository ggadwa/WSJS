- dialog
   - going into game breaks keyboard control
   - keyboard input is SLOW and misses keys

- figure out stuck spider

- profile chrome/safari
- fix slow animation routines (if possible)


- multiplayer
   - initializeMapEntities needs rework
   - make multiple characters
   - make in core.json a section for characters -- use data to replace health
   - need a bot/player json for multiplayerList (rename to character?)


al - easy (simple slow speed, turn radius, bad slop and view angles)
bob - all rounder
Dan - skilled (moderate with better aim)
Greg - more skilled
Jack - speedy (fast, half health)
Larry - tank (slow but double health)
Mike - expert

- transfer over new shadowmaps to mac for later upload

- menu by keys

- gamepad support
- runMultiplayerSyncError redo all this

- kart = weird bug with laps near goal line
- kart = going backwards
- fps = pulses need to be in json

BOTS
   - run away if no ammo?

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - make stand alone application (java - obj format first?)
    - delete bitmap_generated from engine
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
