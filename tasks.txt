   - everything will need to start 10 by 10
   - extensions need to find a spot

- startup list needs to include bitmap building
- clean up stuff at end of generate_bitmap_base
- move all generate stuff to reaper project

- bitmaps
   -> computer (panel variation) - needs glow
   -> hexagon (working) -> add noise like oval
   -> stone is still bad, need some more variations in stone work

   -> second stories have different sets of decorations?
   -> computers (grid)
   -> pipes (force duck/jump)
   -> pillars can have bases
   -> go up and down stairs

   - get rid of ./dist look up docs directory (new File(".").getAbsolutePath() -- test)
   - needs "master" (first in) for games
   - enter
   - leave
   - remotes and updates

- need to make statics for all generate_bitmap_base statics
- room uvs need to be better
- need light patterns (middle, cross, lines, corners, etc)
- need story light spots
- need light model
- door frames
- need to start player outside blocked grid
- star (line) pattern for tiles?  raised squares?
