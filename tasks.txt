WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


1.5: collision for rocket
1.6 merge collision into entity
2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
    - just position/angle and collisions
3. work on collisions
   0a. make sure to combine any lines/floors that we can
4. get back to updateVertexesToPoseAndPosition
4a. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states


- get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW
  (a lot of this has already been deleted, here for future reference)
