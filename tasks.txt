    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass (search all constants)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### connecting platforms fail a lot, figure this out

#### end room big enough for boss?  boss monster?  need boss flag? (config.MONSTER_BOSS)
#### lab decorations
#### stairs need quads or blocks at top
#### frame doors?
#### office decorations (outside like computers)

#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### flyers models
#### draw closest map meshes first
