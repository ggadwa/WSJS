WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]

- chrome 74 has public/private fields, handle those when released

- bots hitscan for player
  - if player in site, after every node hit go directly to next linked node that is closer to player
  * bot chase thing that damaged it

- tinting part of player, need a tint function to call from core (look for getDamageTintAttenuation)
- need spawn nodes
- bot die/respawn


- ammo and stuff needs to reappear
- swimming is broken


- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z
- jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
- combine input / view pause states

project_entity to remove
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)

### LONG TERM ###

- work on safari (need to wait for public/private class fields)
- work on touch controls (left side, move and turn) (right side, look and shoot, swipe left/right weapon change, swipe up for grenade)
- networking
- persistant server storage (H2?)
