    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let (safari hold up)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### make sure grout is darker than bricks/color primary needs a light/dark factor
#### stones can have bigger grout, less bigger grout on bricks
#### wood needs to be more varied with extra pieces
#### plaster is pretty bad, color of lines has to be related to background color
#### hexigons need to be more interesting
#### mosaics need to never include inner color

#### sound constants in soundgen
#### remove soundlist also



# 1 metal type (build a chunk for each type now)
# 1 wood type (with random wood chunks)
# 1 tile type


#### machine -> equipment, have 2 to 4 parts (vertical) each part can be pipe or machine


--------------> do path based maps, always go up, than right?  Corridors that separate blobs?
                    * make room
                    * add up or right corridor
                    * now add other rooms around it
                    * map size by number of encounter rooms?

#### move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)

#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first




* more internal re-arrangement
* fixed Edge browser webgl problem
* reworking of texture generation, much more variance in color and structure
* textures are more random in placement, and pick from a random list instead of a random "type" of thing
