EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] bitmapList.release();
    [ ] soundList.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### glowing computer lights?
#### spikes


#### what's wrong with shots not hitting monsters?
#### monster ai: speed,project=null no projectile
#### deal with health and damage

#### animals better
#### blobs better
#### weapon models

#### are columns in one mesh?  If not, combine them

#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### hit box drawing

#### what's wrong with cylinder light mapping
       - NOT no lights
       - DOES fall through to black chunk
       - NOT last hit mesh optimization
       - SKIPPING black check does nothing
       - NOT out of light cone
       - NOT getting to ray trace
       - NOT ty>by in render triangle
       - !!!! THE DRAW TRIANGLE IS BAD !!!!


       



[X] walls with doors no longer break into other rooms except for door
[X] monsters can have projectiles
[ ] lots of lightmapping updates, highlighted meshes, skipped meshes, bug fixes
[X] ability for meshes to skip light map obscuring (for things like full lit light pieces)
[ ] started work on monster AI variations
[ ] started work on weapon variations
[ ] started work on projectile variations
[X] better debugging tools (exposed in ui config)


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
