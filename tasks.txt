

- !!!NOTE!!! eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)

--> bunch of defs.js that can be deleted
--> map has shader code in it (never call it alone in main.js)

--> hand separate the shaders, map, text, etc.  Setup, draw, take down, repeat.  No list of shaders.  Loading is utility

--> text bitmap needs to deal with .r (count as grayscale) * ambient

- obscuring by view port of meshes
- start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- need font bitmap/fps/drawing routines
   - precreate the text vertex buffer


- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close meshes
    - close gl
    - text.release()
