    [ ] modulize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let (safari hold up)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### Determine decoration type by lists of type depending on room (liquid, story > 1, 1 story, etc)

#### start on platform is broken (needs story marker)

#### path needs to be able to turn corner (and remember if it's top/bottom or left/right for extensions
#### ledges can be taller

#### pipes and machines need to be in rows and chunks (patterns), need room types
         - platform (always when liquid)
         - pillars
         - storage
         - machines
         - computers
         - probably don't need grid stuff anymore (as they don't mix)
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?

#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### ledges on top and bottom?

#### better monster scream

#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room

#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### genBitmapSkin/genBitmapItem in main.js delete later

#### certain decorations in certain rooms (like computers and boxes and such in externals)

#### finish "supergumba" sound parts that aren't workable until panner/listener position gets implemented



#### machine -> equipment, have 2 to 4 parts (vertical) each part can be pipe or machine


--------------> generation
  - doors, lifts, and liquid in map overlay
  - make win button at last room



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile
#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first
