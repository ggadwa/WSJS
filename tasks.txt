WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


0. do a weapon/projectile -> then delete old stuff
1. make a particle effect, then remove old particle effect
   1b. particle shader -> effect shader

2. work on collisions
   0a. make sure to combine any lines/floors that we can

4. get back to updateVertexesToPoseAndPosition
4. weapons and projectiles are own entity class
4a. delete all weapon stuff from player

5. high->height
6. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
7. eventually delete all stuff in entities folder

- get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW
