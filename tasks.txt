IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] can we do static getCONTANT_NAME() { return(1); } etc for constants?  PROBABLY NO, wait for 7?
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();

REGULAR TODOs


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first
    [ ] GET RID OF ALL copy() in defs!  This is super slow path!
    [ ] text drawing is slow
    [ ] point.rotate -- precalc the sin/cos for each part

[ ] models
    [X] 3 types, always generate one of each type -- blob (no limbs) humaniod (limbs on line) animal (limbs downwards)
    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [ ] optimize whatever is slow in creation
    [ ] redo mechanical object creation (for weapons)



[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture
