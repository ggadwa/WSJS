ES6
    [ ] modularize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass (search all constants)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

--> two classes of items, ones in center of room, ones on edges (panels, control panels, ?)
--> right panel is messed up

#### monsters still getting hit by own projectiles
#### need meeles for monsters

#### stairs need quads or blocks at top

#### ai types (charge, sniper, etc)
#### office decorations (outside like computers)
#### lifts instead of platforms in lower levels
#### windows have different bar types
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### model spikes
#### draw closest map meshes first
#### eliminate off meshes/models outside view distance
