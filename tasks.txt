

- !!!NOTE!!! eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)

---> shader.js
       - needs initialize/release
       - move loading stuff to initialize
       - always pass in view
---> have gl be in view
       - get rid of var gl and gl=view.gl in main
       - get rid of all other gls, only from view

---> redo all the statics to be objects


- start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)

- redo input to be a static object

- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
