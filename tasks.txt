ES6
    [ ] modulize the code (do genRandom first)
    [ ] static properties on class, redo these: MapRoomConstantsClass, ModelLimbConstantsClass, ModelConstantsClass

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### need to determine limb movement by body side
#### need to redo all leg movements
       #### put arm stuff in pose arm, so we don't have the if in the case

#### model changes
       #### wrapper needs open positive/negative end flags
       #### vertexes need flags to tell if they are limbAttachVertex
       #### only move those vertexes against the attachment mesh

#### for connected rooms, if lower or upper, try to wedge a room in between the staircase and other room to create open access
#### update the walls decorations
#### path needs to be able to turn corner (and remember if it's top/bottom or left/right for extensions
#### ledges can be taller
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### ledges on top and bottom?
#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### implement reflect for projectiles
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path
#### outside sections
#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models
#### draw closest map meshes first
