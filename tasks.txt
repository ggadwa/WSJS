
*** DO METALLIC/ROUGHNESS TRANSLATIONS
     - generate_bitmap_base / addGenerated needs to change -- search all for "specular" and "glow"
   - do all bitmaps by a class/overrides

dragon queen
 - don't fire projectile if in melee range
 - needs meleeMovementFreezeTick/projectileMovementFreezeTick/hurtMovementFreezeTick/projectileFirePosition (x=0,y=player height*0.5,z=radius*2)


- can we get rid of bitmap simple name after we get rid of all the bitmap collision/etc lists?


GET rid of triangle effect & web effect

- dungeon death pit

- use custom meshes for liquid volumes/hurt volumes/effects/  use lights for lights

- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)

- swipe up for grenade
- delete rest of old demo scripts

SHADOW MAPS
 - uploads need to delete old map/folder


EDIT MODE
  - right click to start split
  - stop all sounds

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping

- bouncing up on bits of pillar in castle map is bad, should not be able to stand on those



BOTS
   - they seem to continue to fight with the dead
   - extra weapon fires (needs config for how often it uses extra weapons)

- kart move out the weapons, clean up entity_kart_player from weapons, implement follow floor projectile

- death messages by game with json setup

- bots/remotes (no need for game json for remotes)

- eventually clean up entity and unecessary pass through APIs



NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes

DEMO
    - made a 2D demo
