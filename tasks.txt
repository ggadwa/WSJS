REGULAR TODOs


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] general
    [X] fixed some bug in lost float/int conversions
    [X] speed up bitmap creation

[ ] map generation
    [ ] DO AWAY with pieces and make everything a 10x10 square?
    [X] flag to make all generated lights white (the default)
    [X] new platforms
        [ ] platforms need more decorations
        [ ] move platforms in another spot after we go 10x10
        [ ] rooms of random # grid spaces?
        [ ] closets always by 2 or greater
        [ ] stairs always by 2 or greater
        [ ] don't have room size, but chunk size
    [ ] TRY: remember closet locations, and from any closet side, expand in 3 direction and fill in if hit another closet

[ ] textures
    [X] added 3 monster textures, scales, fur, and a doom-ish leathery type
    [X] "plaster" texture has more color components
    [X] better stones in rough stone texture
    [X] more variations in wood textures
    [X] metal textures now have a blue-ish tint instead of white tints
    [X] corrigated metal has deeper texture and better normals
    [X] some over-all specular collections

[ ] models
    [X] speed up model creation
    [ ] will need to seam the 0->1 edge

    
    
    [X] fixed a bug that would create split areas in models
    [ ] hands and feet separate globes
        [ ] bad normals in feet because of bone connections
    
    [X] make limbs bilateral
    [X] get legs as booleans (does bone X have legs) and always two

    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [ ] smooth globes or have locked shrink coordinates (like no Y change on body, etc)

[ ] entities
    [X] fixed a bug where entities could spawn in the same place if platforms turned off

[ ] weapons
    [X] add weapon system
    [X] make dynamic weapon model construction
    [X] clear z-buffer?

[ ] projectiles

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
