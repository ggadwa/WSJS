    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let (safari hold up)

When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

#### separate out liquid into own generator
#### make map textures on the fly (bitmapList.get('xxx') make if not there)
#### wood needs to be more varied with extra pieces
#### bricks need more variance
#### textures shouldn't be restricted to certain mesh types (not counting liquids)


--------------> do path based maps, always go up, than right?  Corridors that separate blobs?
                    * make room
                    * add up or right corridor
                    * now add other rooms around it
                    * map size by number of encounter rooms?

#### move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)

#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first




* fixed Edge browser webgl problem
* textures no longer have any color restrictions
