WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up]

1. player can have NULL model
5. addBillboardQuadToGLList is crap, maybe keep an offset and always add up
     - add a rotation factor to it, rotate glow bitmap in flame (and smoke?)

0. transparency sorting
     - when drawing opaque, build into linked list (meshIdx/trigIdx) by view matrix Z in meshList
     - then draw that as transparent
0. when maps final, redo it so we have glossy stuff instead of wacky material bit
1. fix dungeon movements when new map

2a. liquids uv needs to be global so they line up
2b. under liquid is broken
3. need to sort waves too or at least form in direction away from camera
4. waves need wave direction (x/z/none) - get from u/v change

6. be able to start animation paused (at certain second of animation)

elevators in castle fail
bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

1. check billboard effect shaders
2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
