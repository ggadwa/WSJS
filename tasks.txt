


1. fix map uv problem
2. reverse normals on light mapping
3. fix specular math
4. obscuring by view port of meshes
5. start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
6. move around some of the code into more folders


- need font bitmap/fps
- reduce number of varrying to get more lights


- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs
    - need to avoid by reversed normals




-- will need start and stop
    - close meshes
    - close gl
    - text.release()
