EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

REGULAR TODOs



#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding

#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile

#### projectiles
      - bounce, bounce factor (implement)
      - reflect (implement)

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded

#### light mapping is pretty crappy in places, more than likely because of low resolution

#### better wall sliding

#### outside sections


#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### give certain meshes square hit boxes (like pipes and pillars)



[X] room decorations can now be mixed
[X] added pipe decorations
[X] machine decorations don't have cables in open ceiling rooms
[X] larger decorations are no longer allowed to block lights
[X] liquid flag wasn't working properly
[X] fixed a bug where generator would not get even distribution of monster types
[X] blobs have must larger body size ranges and no longer require heads
[X] fixed a bug random body changes could open up seams
[X] animal model types have improved heads
[X] humanoid models have random back hunches
[X] some models can have limbs but no toes or fingers
[X] liquid and damage tinting
[X] monsters turning was broken, and can now face placer when idling
[X] fixed some math problems between model generation and coordinate systems
[X] better monster stalking
[X] lots of clean up in the entity code to commonize all the movement routines between entities
[X] all entities have acceleration/deceleration
[X] swimming physics and updated flying physics
[X] auto-jump out of liquids

[ ] different random speeds for monsters
[ ] add ability for projectiles to have different gravity settings, bounce, and reflect



[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
