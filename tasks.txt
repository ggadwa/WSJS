When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes


- bitmap_base: get rid of all wid=bitmapCanvas.width, always use this to get whole width etc
- might need a non-alias line drawing
- need non-alias everything

- get rid of rooms.length===1 to always make outdoors
- grass is bad
- need outside walls for outdoor areas
- need tree + rock decorations for outdoors
- whats with the resetAnimation errors (on monster wake)
- monster meele, fire and meele sounds

- get rid of settings/getters and do direct, setters and getters are SLLLOOOWWWW

- constants need to be with objects (when statics are there)
- fix the binding bug on projectiles
- playerEntity makes weapons
- track all initialize/release, and don't use close()
- projectiles have ammo & time to fire on them
- weapons have two projectiles only, ammo on projectiles
- bounce projectiles can bounce forever
- projectile speed needs to be > entity speed
- stuff in genMap that can go to constants
- 3rd person view
