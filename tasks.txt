- chrome 74 has public/private fields, handle those when released

- sliding is awful (check spiders)
- bots need X angle targeting
- bots need to get unstuck (put node by platforms, go to nearest node if stuck)

- circleTrigIntersection is bad, big slow down
- monsters need to pause when past pause distance

- networking
- combine input / view pause states

- swimming is broken
- sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
- liquids need to draw away from z

### SAFARI ###

- wait for public/private class fields to land in safari
- work on touch controls (left side, move and turn) (right side, look and shoot, swipe left/right weapon change, swipe up for grenade)
