IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let
    [ ] move setupGrid() in map_room.js
    [ ] move this.setupBounds(); in map_mesh.js

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs

----> redo all the entity nonsense when we have classes
       * getAngle() getPosition() should go back to angle/position and be getters
       * (touchEntity.getName()==='projectile') use instanceof


#### move the alpha to the top to avoid that weird vec4 problem (TEST)
#### stops falling if pushing against a wall

#### don't put non projectile entities in map

#### tails, random vertex moves
#### normals bad in animation (or culling is bad)

    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] general
    [X] fixed some bug in lost float/int conversions
    [X] speed up bitmap creation

[ ] optimizations
     [X] speed up light maps
     [X] get rid of as many news as possible
         [X] collision routines are a really bad spot
     [ ] get rid of any copy()

[ ] map generation
    [X] v2 of map generator
    [ ] decorations updates
         [X] in all rooms
         [X] by block
         [X] stack boxes
         [ ] machine + texture

    [X] flag to make all generated lights white (the default)
    [X] new platforms builder
        [ ] platforms need more decorations
        [ ] try to find a way to connect platforms on different rooms together
    [X] pillars get own class?
    [X] need ledge builder
        [ ] need ledge types
              [ ] current flat ledge
              [ ] wedges
              [ ] supports
        [X] have own ledge texture
        [X] randomize them appearing
        [X] closets block ledges too
        [X] and stairs vs room connections
        [X] need to do opposite on previous room
    [X] blocking needs the concept of platform blocks
    [ ] TRY: remember closet locations, and from any closet side, expand in 3 direction and fill in if hit another closet

[ ] textures
    [X] added 3 monster textures, scales, fur, and a doom-ish leathery type
    [X] "plaster" texture has more color components
    [X] better stones in rough stone texture
    [X] more variations in wood textures
    [X] metal textures now have a blue-ish tint instead of white tints
    [X] corrigated metal has deeper texture and better normals
    [X] some over-all specular collections

[ ] models
    [X] speed up model creation
    [X] will need to seam the 0->1 edge
    [X] animal models need to have body in middle, not at tail end
    
    
    [X] fixed a bug that would create split areas in models
    [ ] hands and feet separate globes
        [ ] bad normals in feet because of bone connections
    
    [X] make limbs bilateral
    [X] get legs as booleans (does bone X have legs) and always two

    [ ] need separate globe sizes for each part
    [X] smooth globes or have locked shrink coordinates (like no Y change on body, etc)

[ ] entities
    [X] fixed a bug where entities could spawn in the same place if platforms turned off

[ ] weapons
    [X] add weapon system
    [X] make dynamic weapon model construction
    [X] clear z-buffer?

[X] projectiles
[X] particles

[ ] need to deal with pausing time stamps

[ ] bitmaps
    [ ] need bitmap colors filters are settings
    [ ] box texture has potential other type of boards inside?
    [ ] machine texture
