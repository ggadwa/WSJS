
--> development needs only loop
     * development on core
     * developerModeExit/Enter
     * pull apart the loops (instead of developer.on stuff)
     - replace developer.on with loop check (or just remove after new loop)
     * get rid of developerDialogs in core
     - maybe don't need developer flags in interface?
     - going into dialog stops music
     - map.entityList.draw(null); needs separate draw for developer
     - figure out lookdown lock
--> X for checkboxes
--> no multiplayer button for non-multiplayer
--> key nodes editing
--> remove main (leave only core) -- maybe?

developer keys
 pageup = enter/exit
 pagedown = change view type
 lookdown???

1. fix start game -> end game -> start game problem

4. title needs to work on iPad
12. iPad touchMenuTrigger (redo, search for it)

- multiplayer complete redo

- fix developer breaking with music/keys
- need float over window for developer UI (do div upper right hand first, draggable later)

- won/lost songs (kart/platformer)

- kart = weird bug with laps near goal line
- kart = need win closing
- kart = going backwards
- platform = warp in/dance warp out sequence
- fps = pulses need to be in json


DEVELOPER
  - work on developer path split
  - stop all movements / liquids

PHYSICS
  - fix wacky bumping (if you bump but can't move fully, than completely stop motion -- check stairs)

BOTS
   - run away if no ammo?

MISC
  - death messages by game with json setup
  - eventually clean up entity and unnecessary pass through APIs
  - get rid of animation index in modelentityalter (only ever have one track)

NETWORKING
    - multiplayer needs a complete rebuild
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

GENERATOR
    - make the whole thing part of developer
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme
    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)
    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line
    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes
