EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] hoist all the vars, eventually use let

WHEN THERE IS AN INTERFACE TODOs
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] map.release();
    [ ] bitmapList.release();
    [ ] soundList.release();
    [ ] modelList.release();
    [ ] entityList.release();
    [ ] text.release();
    [ ] debug.release();

REGULAR TODOs



#### blobs should be able to have random whip limbs
#### stacked block textures can have (randomly) altered Y sizes (one line)
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### tails/whips, spikes, random vertex moves
#### normals bad in animation (or culling is bad)
#### glowing computer lights?
#### rounded particles (need bitmap?)
#### why is some shrinking bad?
      ---> I know what this is, the inside bones are making correct normals, but
           it's a long polygon and the normal is enough to break it, we might need
           a "normal needs to face this direction* and flip otherwise, not sure yet
#### need to separate Y and X/Z globe building segments so we can have more XZ, less Y (or vice versa) on limbs

[X] slight color variations in lighting
[X] packed lights into vec4 to save space, changed light in scene algorithm and now handling 6 lights
[X] some decoration random min/maxes are now dynamic based on room sizes
[X] table decorations is now tables and shelves
[ ] whip limbs


[ ] GL
    [ ] http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/10/oesvertexarrayobject-extension.html
    [ ] draw closest map meshes first

[ ] optimizations
     [ ] look for any addition new optimizations

[ ] sound
     [X] need to create sounds
     [ ] move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play)
