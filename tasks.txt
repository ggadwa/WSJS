IMPORTANT EVENTUAL TODOs
    [ ] eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)
    [ ] remove uncessary .xyz in shaders because of above change

EMCA6 TODOs
    [ ] transfer all object to classes
    [ ] move in the genBitmapObject constants to class based statics
    [ ] modulize the code
    [ ] use Math.trunc when possible instead of Math.floor


[CURRENT BREAK FIXING]
  [X] get debugger to show proper mesh lines
  [X] floors and ceilings share vertices
  [X] need version of shader that just does lighting to figure out normal problems
  [X] eventually delete all supergumba -- testing marks
  [X] transfer light col stuff to model frags

[ ] turn down the specs!
[ ] maybe smaller lights

[ ] we need to share vertices in
    [ ] pryamids
    [ ] cylinders
    [X] squares
    [X] stairs
    [ ] anywhere else polygon -> triangles


[ ] pillars need separate object and pillar locations and ONLY single story rooms
[ ] better second floor stuff

[ ] try to pack glsl light struct floats

[ ] need steel panel rooms

[ ] need real polygonal floors

[ ] rooms have possible light positions

[ ] need to use all black lightmap chunks
[ ] diffuse calcs in light maps
[ ] rooms need decoration locations and decoration models
[ ] need filterMapBitmapColors and filterModelBitmapColors


- keep a list of open 20/20 spots in rooms
    - need flip and mirror


- don't draw spaces in text


collisions
 - gravity


model generation
 - combine close vertexes
 - do torse->waist->hips as separate find calls
    torso size = arm size, hips = leg size, waist = random

---> needs decoration location?
---> make sure to get rid of debug.drawModelSkeleton in view
---> frustum cull the models

- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)


- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - entityList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
