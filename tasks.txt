#### need to group the lights to better pick the lights in each room

#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### genBitmapSkin/genBitmapItem in main.js delete later
#### sound constants in soundgen
#### remove soundlist also

#### move up to spatial panner (sound_list.setListenerToEntity, sound.play) -- BACK TO REGULAR PANNER (ugh)



#### machine -> equipment, have 2 to 4 parts (vertical) each part can be pipe or machine


--------------> generation
  - door and liquid in map overlay
  - remove ROOM_CONNECT_MODE_DOOR
  - need long hallways with two doors (10% of time)
  - make win button at last room

#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### monster speed/health random/projectile,no-projectile
#### implement reflect for projectiles

#### more decorations
      - benches?
      - random platform, then bars or walls, then platform?  pedestal
#### closets more complex?
#### windows like you do closets
#### liquid tint colors are hardcoded
#### be able to attach rounded sections or just use rounded rooms at end of path

#### outside sections

#### model spikes
#### other leg positions
#### flyers models

#### draw closest map meshes first
