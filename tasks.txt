WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up]


0. animations

3. all collision and box routines have to be fixed
6. underwater collision bad

0. move angles to quaternions
1. merge collision into entity
2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
    - just position/angle and collisions
3. work on collisions
   0a. make sure to combine any lines/floors that we can
4. delete all weapon stuff from player
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
6. view -> WSJS?
7. map into view
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics
