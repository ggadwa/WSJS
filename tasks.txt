- fix .bin in KART gltfs
- fix interface in kart
- html is bad

- should bitmaps have "/textures" in them or this assumed? (need to work around map textures)
- in a game json?

- json must be SHARED
- load json ahead of time and fail out at map level if compile bad
- sound play might need position instead of expecting object with .position (as effects call it)
- wsserver - option to show http log in server (default to off)

   - pulse in weapon add ammo
                                    {"type":"pulseInterface","element":"health","tick":500,"expand":5},
                                    {"type":"pulseInterface","element":"pistol_bullet","tick":500,"expand":5},
                                    {"type":"pulseInterface","element":"m16_bullet","tick":500,"expand":5},
                                    {"type":"pulseInterface","element":"grenade","tick":500,"expand":5},

   - redo all the developer stuff as a flag


   ----> current todo
          - index list should be static in effects
          - remove project_effect
          - this.core.projectGame.getBotClass()
          - this.core.projectGame.getRemoteClass()
          - this.core.projectMap=new this.core.projectGame.json.startMap(this.core);
          - finish pistol weapon
          - replace to other weapons
          - put other weapons back in captain chest json
          - do health

        switch (this.data.startMap) {
            case "Dual Castles":
                return(this.createMap(MapDualCastlesClass));
            case "Dungeon":
                return(this.createMap(MapDungeonClass));
        }

    - delete lights
    - fix UV on sign (turn ladder around), delete lights
    - fix UV on finish gate
    - move some trees around
    - put in more power generators        

- need to do some optimizations

- networking
    - entities need boxes passed (radius/height) --> TEST
    - need map_sync message (timestamp + map movements - round robin out to first player) todo partially implemented
    - need to transmit show/hide meshes --> TEST
    - predictions
    - need open system for passing message (like firing weapons, etc)

- generator
    - nodes don't seem right in certain rooms (like boxes)
    - the random color scheme

    - lights
       - regular
       - color changing
       - chasing (4 that go on and off)

    - bitmaps
       - pipe, needs random line & random screw line

    - decorations
       - don't repeat decorations for connected rooms
       - pool decorations
       - moving blocks (half size of segmentSize, in random circular motion)
       - better uv for pillars
       - control panel decorations
       - connectors for pipes

- demo
    - implement bot skill
    - mouse wheel broken chrome/windows
    - fix swimming
