

- !!!NOTE!!! eventually move back to vec3 in lighting structure (sigh, windows bug)

---> start generating models instead of the test model thing

---> redo all the statics to be objects
---> frustum cull the models


- start skeleton work (always start with single, vertical line)
- when building view light list, ignore ones behind the player (pick better lights)

- redo input to be a static object

- light maps
    - light maps need all black, all white spots
       - pre-determine so we can reduce light map usage
    - need diffuse calcs

- will need start and stop
    - close gl
    - map.release();
    - modelList.release();
    - entityList.release();
    - text.release();
    - debug.release();
