WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes

[Models need to have front look DOWN the positive Z, and have positive Y up, uv mapped]


- bots need to determine if on moving platforms
- new way to do tinting
- buffersubdata in text

- bouncing grenade
- why is mouse wheel broken? (sometimes!  pause state?)

need isEntityInRange('player') then check for E key on 

sort effects, will need a sort z call into the effect
entites need data


project_entity clean up
        this.gravityMinValue=10;
        this.gravityMaxValue=280;
        this.gravityAcceleration=10;


2. liquids need to draw away from z

bumps
jumping (make gravityReset() + addMovement(x,y,z) delete other methods)
model angle by quaternions

2. need to get rid of a lot of project_entity stuff, it's very player specific
5. shaders need to be dynamic and part of project
8. combine input / view pause states
9. get rid of constants, use statics

project_entity to remove
    movementBounce(bounceFactor)
    movementJump(jumpValue)
    movementReflect()
    turn(addAngle)
    turnTowards(toY,speed)
    turnTowardsPosition(pos,speed)
    getAngleDifferenceTowardsPosition(pos)
    getPercentageHealth()
    getDamageTintAttenuation()
