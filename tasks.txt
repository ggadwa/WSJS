When interface created
    [ ] close gl
    [ ] all the object release()

WebGL2
    [ ] vertex array objects (liquids, models, map)
           https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl1-to-webgl2.html
           (reason can't do for now, it forces mesh shader setup to be per VAO, and that means repeated lights, etc.)
    [ ] uniform buffers for lights & matrixes





--> room list, light list
--> overlay direct call through to object, movement also
--> need to block off extra edge for up rooms (because of steps)
--> need particle blob (use for explosions)
--> platform, pipe, frame, and pillar need their own texture creation
--> sky is just terrible
--> can we get rid of sound list?  just have sounds (like bitmaps)
--> is model list necessary?

        [X] mapRoomConstants.ROOM_DECORATION_COMPUTER:
              - computer panel has square around lights (possible canary bug, check after chrome 61)
        [ ] mapRoomConstants.ROOM_DECORATION_PIPE:
        [X] mapRoomConstants.ROOM_DECORATION_CUBICAL:
              - raised chunk of floor with stairs
              - bunch of squares you can jump climb?
        [ ] mapRoomConstants.ROOM_DECORATION_LAB:
              - glowing vat texture, glass cylinders

--> models cast light
--> models get hunch as part of body skeleton, not variable



#### monsters still getting hit by own projectiles
#### need meeles for monsters
#### stairs need quads or blocks at top
#### ai types (charge, sniper, etc)
#### office decorations (outside like computers)
#### lifts instead of platforms in lower levels
#### windows have different bar types
#### only put closets in areas that have platforms to them?
#### platforms not knocking out main map mesh walls?
#### item texture is pretty ugly
#### collisions against slanted walls are bad
#### weapon models
#### get rid of weapon fire hard-coding
#### liquid tint colors are hard-coded
#### draw closest map meshes first
